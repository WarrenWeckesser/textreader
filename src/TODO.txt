* Unit tests
* Autodetect dtype
* Handle missing values
* Allow the datetime format to be specified by the user (pass in a format string for use with strptime?)
* Add a 'skiprows' option.
* Handle dtypes of structured arrays properly.  Currently it works for simple cases, but it will
  probably break if given a complicated dtype.
* Handle and report parsing errors.
