* Unit tests
* Autodetect dtype
* Handle missing values.  Currently a missing field is replaced with a value that depends on the
  data type: float -> nan, int -> 0, string -> '', datetime -> 0.
* Allow the datetime format to be specified by the user (pass in a format string for use with strptime?)
  This is started, but it needs review and tests.
* Handle dtypes of structured arrays properly.  Currently it works for simple cases, but it will
  probably break if given a complicated dtype.
* Handle and report parsing errors (e.g. "Invalid floating point value '12..34' in field 3 on line 99").
  Include a check that the number of fields read from the file matches the expected number of fields.
* Add an 'enum' replacement.  This will be a relatively simple replacement scheme, in which a
  dictionary mapping strings to strings is provided.  This can be implemented in C, so it
  should be reasonably fast.
* Add callback converters.  This will allow the user to provide their own python function
  to do conversion.
