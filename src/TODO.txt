* Autodetect dtype
* Handle missing values
* Allow the datetime format to be specified by the user (pass in a format string for use with strptime?)
* Add a 'maxrows' option.  This is the maximum number of rows in the array that is returned.
  When this value is given, the code can skip the precount, and simply allocate an array
  with this many rows.  If the end of file is reached before this number of rows is read, a view
  of the preallocated array is returned
